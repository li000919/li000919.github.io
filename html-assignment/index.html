        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is <em>Xinjie Li</em>, but you can call me <em>Jamie</em>. I'm from China, and I have over six years of experience in marketing and operations. I decided to take this program because I want to combine my background in marketing with more creative and technical skills. This will allow me to explore new opportunities and grow in my career.
        </p>
        <p>It's my 1<sup>st</sup> time in Ottawa and my 1<sup>st</sup> time learning to code in English. However, I'm determined to do my best and learn as much as I can. There's an old saying in China: "The clumsy bird flies early." Following this principle, I've already started learning <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> before the classes began, and now I'm working on <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. With time and effort, I believe I will fully master these skills.
